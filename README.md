## Prerequisites

- Node.js (install it using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- Ruby (install it using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv))

Make sure to add the needed code snippets for nvm and rbenv to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`. You will also have to install [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme) as a rbenv plugin.





<!-- Non admin computers you need to change the ruby `.gem` folder location

With bash, run:

```bash
echo "export GEM_HOME=${HOME}/.gem" >> "${HOME}/.bash_profile" &&\
echo "export PATH=${HOME}/.gem/bin:"'$PATH' >> "${HOME}/.bash_profile" &&\
source ~/.bash_profile
```


if you are using  zsh as shell use, run:

```bash
echo "export GEM_HOME=${HOME}/.gem" >> "${HOME}/.zshrc" &&\
echo "export PATH=${HOME}/.gem/bin:"'$PATH' >> "${HOME}/.zshrc" &&\
source ~/.zshrc
```



Admin computers can install [Ruby Version Manager (rvm) ‚Üí](https://rvm.io).

- needs `gpg` in `$PATH`: `brew install gpg`

-->

## Setup Jekyll & Run Jekyll

**!Note:** This assumes you have Node.js installed with `nvm` and Node.js lts (currently at 12.16.0) installed (`nvm install --lts`). To set a default run `nvm alias default v12.16.0`

```bash
cd /path/to/lab-site/
# only needed once
# install the ruby bundler tool
gem install bundler
# sometimes a specific version is required
# gem install bundler -v 1.17.2
# install all needed node.js dependencies
npm install && cd project-generator && npm install
# go back into the root
cd ..
# install all ruby gems for jekyll
bundle install


# now for each session
# whenever you want to run Jekyll
# run
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
# or even simpler
npm run jekyll
# to generate a new project run in a new session
npm run new
# now follow the prompt‚Ä¶
```

If you run into problems with the eventmachine (incompatible library version) this might help, or not:
```
gem uninstall eventmachine
gem install eventmachine --platform ruby
```

## How To

### Create a New Project

To just create a new article/project you can either,


- copy one of the existing folders
- give it a new name (no whitespace and special characters please üôè)
- adjust all the variables in the frontmatter of the files
  - `source/projects/<YOUR NEW PROJECT>/de/index.[html|md]`
  - `source/projects/<YOUR NEW PROJECT>/en/index.[html|md]`
- make sure your Markup is right
- push it to the remote repo (the build will be done automagically)

Or even better you can use the project generate. (See infos in section **Project Generator**).

**!Hint:** When you already have existing HTML on the old site you can grap the source from the GitHub repo and convert it to **[M‚¨áÔ∏é]** using for example these online tools:

- [Turndown Demo Page](https://domchristie.github.io/turndown/)
- [Pandoc Demo Page](https://pandoc.org/try/?text=&from=html&to=markdown_strict)

There might be some leftovers within the **[M‚¨áÔ∏é]** that you need to remove manually.


### Editing Content

When writing simple markdown all the text will be

- in one single column
- images will have no caption
- images will span the column

If you want a specialized layout you can use the macros included in `source/_includes`

- macro-blockqoute-section.html
- macro-code-snippet.html
- macro-image-column.html
- macro-image-section-markdown.html
- macro-image-section.html
- macro-image.html
- macro-link.html
- macro-navigation-item.html
- macro-text-column.html
- macro-text.html


The most common one will be the `macro-image-section-markdown.html` (if you write **[M‚¨áÔ∏é]**). The usage would look like this.

```html
{% include macro-image-section-markdown.html src="../images/cat.png" caption="Here is a picture of a cat" %}
```

If you locate your images in the `images` folder you can use relativ urls.

**!Hint:** The images used in the frontmatter should have absolut paths with the folder `source` as the root project folder. They are used on other pages as well.

---

Below is a table of all the parameters you can give to them.

| name                                   | parm1 | parm2   | parm3  | param4   |
| :------------------------------------- | :---- | :------ | :----- | :------- |
| macro-text.html                        | text  | --      | --     | --       |
| macro-text-column.html                 | title | text    | --     | --       |
| macro-image-section-markdown.html      | src   | caption | --     | --       |
| macro-image-section.html               | src   | caption | --     | --       |
| macro-blockqoute-section.html          | text  | info    | --     | --       |
| macro-blockqoute-section-markdown.html | text  | info    | --     | --       |
| macro-code-snippet.html                | code  | --      | --     | --       |
| macro-image-column.html\*              | title | text    | images | reversed |
| macro-image.html                       | src   | alt     | --     | --       |
| macro-link.html                        | href  | text    | type   | --       |

\* the image column accepts html markup as the `images` content. Should be used in conjunction with macro-image.html

For some of these macros you will need to use the Jekyll templating syntax called liquid. See the shopifys wiki [Liquid for Designers](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) for a in depth reference.

In our macros you will use three different syntax constructs. capture, assign and include.

#### Capture

TO capture some content for later use you insert this syntax.

```plain
{%  capture variable  %}code{%  endcapture  %}
```

In use it is like this:

```html
{% capture myvaribale %}
This is some captured content. It will be stored in the variable "myvaribale".
{% endcapture %}
<!-- now use this later on -->
{% include macro-text-column.html title="My Title" text=myvaribale -%}

```

#### Assign

Assign also creates a variable. The difference is that you assign it directly to the variable and don't capture longer blocks.

```html
{% assign myvariable = "This is the content of myvariable" %}
<!-- later on you can use this variable -->
This is some random text with a inserted variable --> {{myvariable}}
<!-- or you use the variable on an include -->
{% include macro-text-column.html title="My title" text=myvaribale -%}

```

#### Include

The include looks in the folder `source/_include` for the file that should be included and expands its content during site generation.

```html
{% include snippet.extension param1="foo" param2="bah" %}
```

#### Variables

Additionally all values in the frontmatter are available as `page.variables`.

You can use them like this:

```html
This is the title {{page.title}} this is the language {{page.lang}}
```

Of course you can add your own variables.



#### HTML in [M‚¨áÔ∏é]

You can mix **[M‚¨áÔ∏é]** with HTML, just make sure you don't mix block level markup. E.g. This wont work!

```html
Dies ist ein Typoblindtext.<div>someHTML</div>
```

This will work:

```html
Dies ist ein Typoblindtext.

<div>someHTML</div>
```

#### Example Projects for Reference

To see how all if this is used to to the example projects source `source/projects/example-html-project/en/index.html`.

If your Jekyll development server is running you can go to these URLs

- **HTML EN:** [http://localhost:4000/projects/example-html-project/en/](http://localhost:4000/projects/example-html-project/en/)
- **HTML DE:** [http://localhost:4000/projects/example-html-project/de/](http://localhost:4000/projects/example-html-project/de/)
- ****[M‚¨áÔ∏é]** EN:** [http://localhost:4000/projects/example-md-project/en/](http://localhost:4000/projects/example-md-project/en/)
- ****[M‚¨áÔ∏é]** DE:** [http://localhost:4000/projects/example-md-project/de/](http://localhost:4000/projects/example-md-project/de/)

### Project Assets

#### Images

Within your project folder you can add all your projects assets. There are some files that are required.

| Description    | width in PX | height in PX | comment                |
| :------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :--------------------- |
| Hero image     | 2400        | 1400         | --                     |
| Thumbnail      | 600         | 600          | --                     |
| Featured image | 2400        | 1800         | needs an alpha channel |

#### JS & CSS

You can have additional JS and CSS files for your project. Add them to the frontmatter in the `assets` section and they will be included in the head of your project.

**!Hint:** To make sure your JS executes when the [full document is loaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded) execute it in this event listener.

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function() {
// your code goes in here
});
```

If you want to be super sure that everything is loaded you should use the [load event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/load):

```js
window.addEventListener("load", function(event) {
// Your code here
});
```

## YAML Frontmatter

All variables for your project are located in the YAML frontmatter. You can see the current template for the frontmatter (with comments) [here ‚Üí](project-generator/src/frontmatter.yml).

- A quick guide on yaml can be found [here ‚Üí](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)
- The whole specification for YAML is [here ‚Üí](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)

## Project Generator

Run `npm run new-project` To get this help.
To pass arguments to it use the dash dash whitspace `npm run new-project -- ` and then your arguments.


```plain
> ./project-generator/bin/run --help

Generate a new project for @technologiestiftung

USAGE
  $ project-generator [TITLE]

ARGUMENTS
  TITLE  The folder for the new project. (Whitspace will be replaced uppercase as well)

OPTIONS
  -f, --force         üíÄ force the overwrite of existing files.
  -h, --help          show CLI help

  -p, --prompt        Use the interactive prompt to fill the yaml frontmatter
                      (if not used a default will be inserted)

  -t, --type=md|html  [default: md] the type of project possible "md" or "html"

  -v, --version       show CLI version

DESCRIPTION
  When you run this from a npm-scripts in our project
  you have to add `--` to execute the commands. E.g.

       Call the help:
       $ npm run new-project -- --help

       Or generate a new project with HTML files under
       /source/projects/my-cool-project/‚Ä¶
       with the default frontmatter:
       $ npm run new-project -- "my cool project" -t html

       Or start the interactive prompt for generating your yaml frontmatter
       $ npm run new-project -- -p

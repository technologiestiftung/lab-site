The Ideation & Prototyping Lab also wants to keep pace in the age of increasing automation and has therefore transformed the Bluetooth radio belonging to [CityLAB Berlin](https://www.citylab-berlin.org/) into a web radio. The resulting tutorial deals with the **Raspberry Pi** (RasPi), its **autostart configuration** & **Bluetooth radios**. This articel describes how all these thing are connected to each other and how to hack an autoplay web radio with the help of a RasPi. You can find the detailed tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/werkstatt/blob/master/HowTo_WebRadio.md)*.

## Basic Idea
In times of increasing automation we wanted to look behind the scenes once more and hack a bluetooth-capable radio to an autoplay web eadio with the help of a Raspberry Pi 3 and a **autostart program**. The communication from the laptop to the RasPi is done via SSH - from the RasPi to the radio via Bluetooth. The whole configuration (Bluetooth, VLC mediaplayer command, delays etc.) was written into a **Shell-Script** which was finally linked to the autostart file of the Raspberry. 

## Necessary Hard- and Software
Realization of this project ist pretty easy due one need not too much hardware:
* a laptop
* a Raspberry 3 and
* a bluetooth-capable radio

Of course the tutorial also works with other single board computers based on Linux - as long as they have an internal chipset for the WI-FI and Bluetooth function.

First, an operating system must be set up on the RasPi, in our case Rasbian, so that one can finally use the laptop to communicate with the Raspberry. After the successful installation of the operating system, the configuration of the Raspberry can be started. Depending on whether the RasPi is to be operated headless (via SSH) or with head (via keyboard and monitor), the **network protocol Secure Shell (SSH) serves as communication interface** to our RasPi. In our tutorial we descriped the operation of a headless RasPi using SSH and, in addition, higlighted the cryptographic encryption procedure of the SSH.

## Connect RasPi with the radio
Most of us connect to other devices via Bluetooth on a daily basis - simply by using the Graphic User Interface (GUI) with keyboard and mouse. Of course, this is way faster. However, in our workshop we only connect with a few terminal commands, because this is basically the **magic of automation**. If you save the commands in a shell script and include this small script in the autostart of the Raspberry, the Raspberry automagically connects to the Bluetooth radio at the next boot. 

To connect to the radio, the following commands are necessary whereby the MAC address of the radio must be replaced with that of your own radio (comments are not shown within the terminal):
```shell
$ bluetoothctl
> Agent registered

$ [bluetooth]# power on
> changing power on succeeded

$ [bluetooth]# default-agent
> Default agent request successful

$ [bluetooth]# pairable on
> changing pairable on succeeded

//important .command in case you want to connect twice to one and the same device
$ [bluetooth]# remove 12:34:56:78:9A:BC
> changing pairable on succeeded

// scan environment for Bluetooth devices; MAC address of radio should appear
$ [bluetooth]# scan on
> Discovery started
> [CHG] Device 12:34:56:78:9A:BC 12-34-56-78-9A-BC

$ [bluetooth]# scan off
> Discovery stopped

//pair to radio (!= connect)
$ [bluetooth]# pair 12:34:56:78:9A:BC
> Attempting to pair with 12:34:56:78:9A:BC
> [CHG] Device 12:34:56:78:9A:BC Connected: yes
> [CHG] Device 12:34:56:78:9A:BC ServicesResolved: yes
> [CHG] Device 12:34:56:78:9A:BC Paired: yes
> Pairing successful

//check if the pairing really worked; radio should be listed
$ [bluetooth]# devices
> Device 12:34:56:78:9A:BC MeinRadioName

//automatically connect to the device (radio) when it is switched on
$ [bluetooth]# trust 12:34:56:78:9A:BC
> [CHG] Device 12:34:56:78:9A:BC Trusted: yes
> Changing 12:34:56:78:9A:BC trust succeeded

//finally: connect to radio
$ [bluetooth]# connect 12:34:56:78:9A:BC
```

## Web Radio per Autostart abspielen

To make result is audible, we have added another command to the shell script.
```shell
$ vlc myPlaylist.m3u
```
Using this command, the already pre-installed VLC media player of your RasPi opens playlist "myPlaylist". With this command, all files like mp3 files or other playlists, for example the playlist of your favorite web radio, are played one after the other. The playlist only needs to contain a URL to the corresponding web radio station.

**Last but not least: include the shell script in the autostart** To include a program in the autostart of the Raspberry, there are several ways. In our tutorial we've created a **.dektop file** to run our script every time the RasPi is booting up. 
```shell
$ sudo geany /etc/xdg/autostart/nameOfYourFile.desktop&
```
Nice to know: by using the commercial "and" at the end of the command, you can still operate the terminal even though the text editor is open.
The .desktop files have a prescribed schematic structure which has to be considered.
```plain
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=anyName
Terminal=false
Exec=/bin/sh /usr/bin/myScript.sh
```
After the attribute "Exec=..." the command to be executed at autostart is specified. Since we need several commands for the connection via Bluetooth and the playback of the web radio station, we would like to line a shell script "myScript.sh" which contains all the commands.

## Little Teaser

If you got quite excited and would like to become active yourself, you can find further instructions in the detailed [tutorial on GitHub](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/werkstatt/blob/master/HowTo_WebRadio.md). Among other things it explains how:
* the IP of the RasPi can be queried
* the RasPi can be controlled via SSH
* the .desktop autostart file should be created and stored
* the audio output of the Raspberry can be set up
* and much more.

For those who don`t have a RasPi at home, one can borrow **RasPi's + accessories for free via [Hacking Box](https://www.technologiestiftung-berlin.de/hackingbox/).** In addition, the [CityLAB Berlin](https://www.citylab-berlin.org/) offers monthly participative workshops on topics such as Internet of Things, microcontrollers, Smart Home and hardware hacking.

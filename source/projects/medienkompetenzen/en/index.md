# Everything is going digital. Everything! Everyone can do it digitally. Everyone?

## Libraries and digital literacy

Access to information and thus also access to social participation are core elements of the work of public libraries. They make an important contribution to the fulfillment of the fundamental right "to be informed freely from generally accessible sources" (Article 5, paragraph 1). This also includes empowerment tasks, i.e. imparting skills or support in learning new cultural techniques.

The teaching of skills to participate in the increasingly digital society is a broad field of activity for libraries. An important strategic area of ​​action for public libraries is emerging here, particularly with regard to developments in the field of e-government or the online access law.

A not inconsiderable number of citizens cannot confidently handle digital communication technology. This means that many of the services that are now necessary to cope with everyday processes remain closed to them. Berlin therefore needs a modern infrastructure in order to open access to digital processes to all parts of the population regardless of income and education. The public libraries want to fulfill this educational mandate.

## Pilot Project

The **Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin (ZLB)**** and the **Technologiestiftung Berlin** are jointly developing a pilot project with the aim of imparting basic knowledge of media and digital skills to citizens, so that citizens can carry out the increasing range of services offered by government services safely and independently, while doing one full social participation, even where it is based on digital processes.

## Planning and organization

Three libraries in Berlin (Buch, Berlin / Mitte and Neukölln) will start the pilot project. At each of these locations, a fully equipped and protected digital workplace with advice from library staff will be available. The supervising library staff receive targeted training within the project framework. This gives users help to learn how to request and process administrative services online, such as: applying for a certificate of good conduct, day care center vouchers, requesting appointments at the civil service office, etc.

No specialist or legal advice is offered, but advice and support in learning skills that are fundamentally necessary to use the digital administration offer, e.g. searching and finding information.

## The pilot project should find out

- what support users need for online processes
- Which demand-oriented program offers are needed for the teaching of digital skills
- What online services there are for citizens and what their usability looks like
- how service offers can be developed further
- how digital sovereignty can be spread
- What contribution can be made in the project framework to digital services of general interest

## online services

In the first phase of the pilot project, an offer for the following administrative services will be available at all 3 locations:

## Citizen Services

- Registration office (dates)
- eID (electronic identification) registration and possible uses
- Registration KITA / KITA voucher
- Criminal record
- Apartment registration and registration

## Benefits for migrants

- Residency permit
- Work permit for students

## Organizational services

## Project goal

Our aim is to take as many digitally insecure citizens as possible with this pilot project and to take away the uncertainty and fear of the rapid development of digital applications through our offer. We believe that public libraries are the right place to acquire media and digital skills, because libraries are already established as open meeting places with an information mandate. Your offer to impart knowledge in various cultural techniques is accepted and can be expanded and supported by our project.

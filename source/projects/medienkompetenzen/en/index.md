## Libraries and digital literacy

Right now it is becoming even more visible: For many reasons, it is not possible for many people to use digital communication technology confidently or only with great difficulty. This means that information, debates and, increasingly, many services that are now necessary to deal with everyday processes remain closed to them. Berlin urgently needs a modern infrastructure in order to open access to digital processes to all parts of the population regardless of income and education. The public libraries and the Technologiestiftung Berlin want to meet this need.

Helping people to help themselves is a matter of course for public libraries, even with orientation and support in the digital space. Municipal utilities, insurance companies and the Berlin and federal administrations are increasingly offering their services online. For this reason, it takes personal mediation in addition to good infrastructure to also reach people who can not find their way around the Web applications that do not have a smart phone or computer or those handling it still difficult.

The "Citizens' Advice Terminal" project is to develop ideas for solutions, in order to counteract the threat of exclusion from the digital society. These will be tried out and further developed in the project.

Together with the Technologiestiftung Berlin, the Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin started a one-year pilot phase of the project in November 2019: In 2020, experiences with so-called prototypes are to be gained in the America Memorial Library, in the Buch district library and in the Neukölln district central library. For the support of users of the terminals, further training for the library colleagues is designed, organized and carried out, so that in the future a proven library staff at the citizen advice terminal can support the libraries. After evaluation of the test run should be worked out to set up a Citizens Advice terminal in a public library in each district of Berlin.

## Pilot Project

**The Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin (ZLB)** and the **Technologiestiftung Berlin** are developing a pilot project. Digital participation should be made possible regardless of previous knowledge and prerequisites, even for people who are unable or only limitedly able to use digital technologies.

## Planning and organization

Three libraries in Berlin (Buch, Berlin/Mitte and Neukölln) will participate in the prototype phase. At each of these locations is a full-featured and protected digital workplace associated with consulting services by employees of the library. The supervising library staff receive targeted training within the project framework. This gives users help to learn how to request and process administrative services online, such as: applying for a certificate of good conduct, day care center vouchers, requesting appointments at the civil registry office, etc.

No specialist or legal advice is offered, but advice and support in learning skills that are fundamentally necessary to use the digital administration offer, e.g. searching and finding information.

## The pilot project should find out

- exactly what the need for such offers looks like.
- what support users need for online processes.
- Which demand-oriented program offers are needed for the teaching of digital skills.
- Which online services are available for women and what their usability looks like.
- how service offers can be developed further.
- as well as the consultation areas can actually looks like.
- how digital sovereignty can be spread.
- what contribution can be made in the project framework for digital public services.

# Everything is going digital. Everything! Everyone can do it digitally. Everyone?**

No small number of citizens can confidently use digital communication technology, although the reasons for this vary widely: they cannot read or write, have never learned to use digital applications, or have simply spent most of their lives at one time. did not play a role in everyday life as a computer. But without digital literacy, many services that use online transactions to manage everyday processes remain closed to citizens.

### ** pilot project **

The Die Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin (ZLB) and the Technologiestiftung Berlin are jointly developing a pilot project with the aim of imparting basic knowledge of media and digital skills to citizens, so that citizens can complete the increasing range of services offered by government services safely and independently, while ensuring full social participation, wherever it relies on digital processes.

### ** Why do libraries offer themselves as a place? **

Access to information and thus also access to social participation are core elements of the work of public libraries. They make an important contribution to the fulfillment of the fundamental right to "freely obtain information from generally accessible sources" (Basic Law Article 5, Paragraph 1). The imparting of competencies for participation in the increasingly digital society is a generic field of activity for libraries and with regard to eGovernment or the Online Access Act an important strategic field of action is currently developing for public libraries.

### ** How should it look like? **

Three libraries in Berlin (Buch, Berlin / Mitte and Neuk√∂lln) will start the pilot project. At each of these locations, a fully equipped digital workplace with supportive advice from library staff will be available. As far as possible, this workplace will be visually and acoustically shielded and should offer a pleasant atmosphere.

The supervising library staff receive targeted training within the project framework. No specialist or legal advice is offered, but advice and support in learning the skills that are essential for using the digital administration offer.

In the first phase of the pilot project, an offer for the following administrative services will be available at all 3 locations:

** Citizens' Services **

- Registration office (dates)
- EID registration and possible uses
- Registration KITA / KITA voucher
- Criminal record
- Apartment registration and registration

** Benefits for migrants **

- Residency permit
- Work permit for female students

** Organizational services **

- Set up email
- Make doctor's appointments online

### **Project goal**

Our aim is to take as many digitally insecure citizens as possible with this pilot project and to take away fears and shyness of the rapid development of digital applications through our offer. Public libraries are the right place to acquire media and digital skills because they are already established as open meeting places with an information mandate and are suitable for keeping the threshold for the users of this pilot project low.

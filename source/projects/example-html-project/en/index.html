    This week we launched our new app Badestellen Berlin. This was a joint effort of Kompetenzzentrum Wasser, {% include macro-link.html href="/" content="Berliner Wasserbetriebe" type="foo" %} and the LaGeSo. The new application allows citizens to get up to date information on bathing water quality. Besides water quality information the site provides additional info on each site, for example, accessibility features or availability of toilets and parking lots. A link to a routing service and the local public transport service allow you to conveniently plan your next trip.

description: Kita-Suche should support parents to find the best Kita for their children.
  The innovative search- and filter-functionality as well as the map-based
  representation are driven by data from the city of Berlin. Through examples
  like this, the ideation and prototyping labs hopes to promote the benefits of
  open data for citizens and the city itself.

<div id="kita-intro">
  <p class="kita-number"><span class="kita-big">179.678 Children</span><br><span class="kita-small">between the age of 1 and 6 years</span></p>

</div>

<p>About 180.000 children between the age of 1 and 6 years are living in the city of Berlin (State: Dezember 2016). More than 2.500 Kitas (childcare/daycare) are serving those in need, spread throughout the city of Berlin.</p>

<div class="special-section" id="map"></div>

<p>Even though, some districts have a little more children per 50 inhabitants than the average district (e.g. Pankow and Lichtenberg), most districts show a similar pattern. Due to higher population density and district size, districts like Pankow and Mitte need to support a larger number of children than their neighbouring districts.</p>

<div class="special-section" id="icons">
  <div id="icon_controlls">
      <span class="db db-left active">Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;children&nbsp;per&nbsp;50&nbsp;inhabitants</span>&shy;<span class="db db-right">Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;children&nbsp;per&nbsp;district</span><br><br>
      <img src="../images/Icon-explain.png" alt="Icon fÃ¼r Kind">&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="def">equals about 453 children between the age of 1 and 6 years</span>

<p>The senate administration for education, youth and family is already providing their citizens with access to information on all of Berlin's Kitas through a <a href="https://www.berlin.de/sen/jugend/familie-und-kinder/kindertagesbetreuung/kitas/verzeichnis/">search engine</a>. The Ideation &amp; Prototyping lab is continuously exploring novel user-friendly interfaces in order to enable citizens to explore their cities data vaults. As a result, we build a map-based <a href="http://www.kita-suche.berlin">search interface</a>, which allows citizens to find their local Kita.</p>
